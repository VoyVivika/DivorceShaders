# VoyVivika's Divorce Shaders
![Shader Preview](https://github.com/VoyVivika/DivorceShaders/blob/main/README%20ASSETS/Unity_Xwahnfhmvv.gif?raw=true)
The Divorce Shaders are a Suite of Shaders created by VoyVivika in Unity3D with the Amplify Shader Editor, it's designed to essentially be "Standard Shader with some more Bells and Whistles". I made these for my Personal Avatar after N3X15 told me to be part of the *"Not Using Poiyomi Gang."*
## Features
- Light AudioLink Support (Optional)
- Vertex UV Tile Discard (Like Poiyomi)
- Rim Lighting
### MultiMap
MultiMap is a Texture which contains multiple maps in 1
Currently the Spec for the Divorce Shader Multi-Map is
- Red Channel = Metalic
- Green Channel = Smoothness
## Why are they called "Divorce Shaders"
*In short: I thought it'd be funny.*
I made a Prop in ChilloutVR that's literally just a jpeg of a Divorce Agreement Document, then I said to a friend "I'm going to make the Divorce Shaders" so I decided to give that name to these Shaders.
